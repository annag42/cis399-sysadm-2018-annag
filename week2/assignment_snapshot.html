    <h1>Assignment for Week 2: Amazon EC2 instance creation</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>In this assignment your team will create a few Amazon EC2 virtual
    machine instances you'll be using for the rest of the course.
    You'll also explore some of the basic properties of an instance.

    <h2>What you need to do</h2>

    <ol>

    <li>Create a key pair for yourself in the EC2 console under "Key
    Pairs", giving it a name clearly related to your AWS login name.
    Click the "Create Key Pair" button and save the resulting key
    pair.  <em>Be careful with this file!</em>  Do not place it anywhere
    where other people can access it.  For added protection, encrypt the
    private key with a password using "ssh-keygen -p" or the equivalent.
    See <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html">Amazon
    EC2 Key Pairs</a> for more details on how to create and manage a
    personal key pair.

    <li>Launch three EC2 instances.  Each team member needs to launch at
    least one instance.  Use these properties for your instances:

      <ul>

      <li>Select the "US West (Oregon)" region in AWS, which is needed
      for some of the other things below to be visible.  The region menu
      is at the upper right of the console page, between your
      "user@uo-cis-sysadm-class" menu and the "Support" menu.

      <li>Choose AMI: Use one of the "free tier" Linux machine images.
      One of the Ubuntu types is recommended but Red Hat and SUSE Linux
      are also available.

      <li>Choose Instance Type: t2.nano

      <li>Configure Instance Details:

        <ul>

	<li>Network: lab-cloud

	<li>Subnet: choose your team's subnet

	</ul>
      <li>Configure Security Group: Select an existing security group,
      then select "default (default VPC security group)"

      <li>Once you have selected all of these, you can finally launch
      the instance.  Make sure to choose your own key pair for access
      and not somebody else's.

      </ul>

    <li>Obtain your own public key by logging in to your instance and
    getting the contents of the file .ssh/authorized_keys.  Add access
    for your other team members by adding lines to .ssh/authorized_keys
    containing their public keys.  You should be careful with this since
    you could lock yourself out of your instance if you damage that
    file.  A recommended process:

      <ol>

      <li>Log in to the session and back up the authorized_keys
      file: <tt>cp .ssh/authorized_keys authorized_keys_backup</tt>

      <li>Edit the .ssh/authorized keys file to add a public key line from
      another team member.  Make sure your editor doesn't wrap words or
      lines.

      <li>You and your team member should try to initiate separate
      logins to the instance to be sure you can both get in.

      <li>If you're not able to get in, use your existing login session
      to restore your backup: <tt>cp authorized_keys_backup
      .ssh/authorized_keys</tt>.
      </ol>

    </ol>

    <h2>What to turn in</h2>

    <p>Create a subdirectory in your team git repository with the name
    "week2" and create files containing your handin materials under
    that.

    <ol>
    
    <li>List the EC2 instance IDs and private IP addresses of all the
    instances you created.

    <li>Describe how you find the public IP address of a given instance
    using the EC2 console.  (The public IP address may change whenever
    an instance is stopped and restarted.)

    <li>Provide the output of a command showing how much disk space one
    of your instances has.

    <li>Provide the output of a command showing how much memory one of
    your instances has.

    <li>Provide a listing showing all the processes running in one of
    your instances.

    <li>Provide the output of a command showing the network interface
    configuration of your instance (this should show its private IP
    address).

    <li>Provide the output of a command showing the routing table of
    your instance.

    <li>Provide the output of a command showing all of the open network
    connections and ports on one of your instances.

    <li>Provide a listing of all of the software packages installed on
    one your instances.

    <li>Provide transcripts showing the output of the commands you use
    to update your package database and upgrade packages on each of your
    instances.
    
    </ol>

    <p>Material for all of the above should be checked into your team
    git repository by class time on Monday, July 10.

    <h2>Class presentation/discussion</h2>
    <p>On Monday, July 10 we will take some time in class to have everyone
    speak briefly about their experience with this assignment.

    <h2>Evaluation</h2>

    <p>Each item under "What to turn in" is worth one point.
